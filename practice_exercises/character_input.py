name = input("What is your name? ")  # input for name
age = int(input("How old are you? "))  # input for age
years = 100 - age  # calculate how long until 100
print(f"Hello, {name}, you will be 100 years old in {years} years!")  # print output


''' SOLUTION:
name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
year = str((2014 - age)+100)
print(name + " will be 100 years old in the year " + year)
