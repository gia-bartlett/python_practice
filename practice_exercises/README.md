##### 1. Character input:  

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.  
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.  

Skills used:  
creating variables  
input() - gaining input from the user to assign values to the variables  
using the int() method to make sure the age is an integer  
using the -(minus) operator  
print() - printing the response  
formatting - using f formatting to fill the blanks  


##### 2. Odd or Even:  

Ask the user for a number.  
Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.  

Skills used:  
creating variables  
input() - gaining input from the user to assign values to the variables  
using the int() method to make sure the number is an integer  
using the %(modulo) operator to see if the number is divisible by 2 (therefore is even)  
if...else statement    
print() - printing the response  
formatting - using f formatting to fill the blanks   


##### 3. Less than ten:  

Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.  

Skills used:  
for loop  
if statement  
print()  
< less than comparator  

##### 4. Divisors:  

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.  

Skills used:  
defining a function  
for loop  
if statement  
print()  
< less than comparator  
creating an empty list []  
% modulo operator  
.append() to add to empty list  

##### 5. List Overlap:  

Take two lists and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).  
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.  

Skills used:  
defining a function  
for loop  
if statement  
print()  
creating an empty list []  
.append() to add to empty list  
not  

##### 6. List Overlap:  

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
